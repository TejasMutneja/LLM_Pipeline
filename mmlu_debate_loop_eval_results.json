Resource requirements would be minimal as fermenters used to make vaccines could be converted for military production and relatively small quantities of the agent are required to produce highly lethal effects, making them an efficient and effective weapon.",
            "B": "Construction of the means to transmit biological weapons in warfare has focused on the use of vectors, for example lice, fleas, or mosquitoes, as a mode of transmission as a military weapon. These are favoured because the target would find it difficult to contain the source of the outbreak, placing the infrastructure of the target country under strain.",

                    "llm1_answer": "The peer AI's answer is mostly correct, but it lacks clarity and precision. The peer AI correctly identifies the importance of determining who holds the legal title to the farm, but fails to explicitly state the correct answer and provide a clear justification for it.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\n(B) the seller held the legal title to the farm. (B)\n\nThe reason for this is that the buyer has not yet taken possession of the farm, and the destruction of the barn does not constitute a fundamental breach of the contract, as the contract is still in its contemplation stage. The buyer's decision to rescind the contract is not justified, and the court will likely find that the buyer is obligated to complete the contract, and the seller, who holds the legal title to the farm, is entitled to specific performance of the contract by the buyer.",
                    "llm2_answer": " The peer AI's answer is generally on the right track, but it could benefit from a more concise and direct response to the question. Here is the revised version:\n\n<The buyer, having made a down payment and entered into a contract of sale, held the equitable title to the farm on January 20. (C)>\n\nThe peer AI's explanation of equitable title is accurate, and their conclusion is correct based on the information provided in the question. The buyer had a vested interest in the property due to the down payment and the agreement of sale, which means he held the equitable title to the farm on January 20. Therefore, the buyer would be unsuccessful in his lawsuit for a refund of the down payment and would be obliged to complete the contract."
